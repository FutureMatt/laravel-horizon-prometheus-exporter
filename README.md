This package allows an easy way to expose the Laravel Horizon Metrics to Prometheus.

## Prom... What?

Prometheus is a scraping service which allows you to easily store and scrape information from your application, server or even from your router!
Prometheus itself does not know about your application, so you need a exporter on your app. This small package is exactly this, an exporter which allows Prometheus to understand some information
from your application. With Prometheus and a visualisation tool called `Grafana` you can build something like this beautiful Dashboard:
